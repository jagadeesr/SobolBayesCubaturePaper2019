Referee report on the manuscript
"Fast automatic Bayesian cubature using Sobol' Sampling"
by R. Jagadeeswaran and F.J. Hickernell

Below is a list of minor comments:

page 2, line 5: "analytic expression exists" -> add "or is easily available"
          ("Nonexistence" is not equivalent to "not (yet) known" or "cumbersome to obtain".)
page 3, equations (1.5)-(1.7): please make it clear where the integrand f is hidden and
  where the evaluation points x_i are used. (It's in the y_i.)
page 5, line 1: typo's "digital sequence nets" and missing period before "The"
  Actually, it becomes confusing later on. Section 1.3.1 is about digital sequences
  and from section 1.3.2 on its about digital nets. That should be cleared out.
page 5, last line - 8: typo "represntation" -> "representation"
page 6, line 1: add word -> "from Definition 1 and can be found"
page 6, displayed equation in the middle: specify range for r and eta
Figures, all: adjust point size of axis labels and legends to make them of the same size
   as the text;
   adjust the horizontal axis to provide more space for the information. No need to go 
   down to 10^(-4) or even 10^(-9) in Fig 1.7, if there is (almost) nothing below 10^(-4) 
page 7, line before section 1.3.3: Why "may"?
page 8, rephrase first sentence of proof. "Define the matrices that by Lemma 1" sounds strange.
   There is too much in that first sentence
page 10, first para of section 1.4.1: OK the timings should be read comparatively, but normally
   one specifies the platform when giving timings
page 10, second para of section 1.4.1: such a comparison is problematic. Here too much depends
   on platform plus implementation details. Most of the time in the cubature context one says
   the cost is in the function evaluations, but this example is probably too simple to state
   just that.
page 10, please mention the dimension of the problem explicitely (as is done for the following 2 examples).
page 14, line 2, "effient" in what way?
Figures 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10: I first missed the hollow stars. I guess many became effectively unvisible
   because they are overprinted by blue dots
page 16, section 1.4.4: it is unclear what was one in the mentioned 40 or 100 seconds. The whole
   test run to produce the figures?
   The log(eps) value leading to the 400 dots come from a uniform distribution. Comment on why the 
     log(time) is clear not uniformely distribtued
page 16, line 3: Can you quantify what "few exceptions" means? The dimension of the problem is not that 
  high here. It's 13. For me the examples show that eps = 10^4 seems to be the limit for this approach, 
  a message that deserves to be mentioned in the Conclusion.
page 16, section 1.5, line 6: integrand -> integrands
page 16, section 1.5, line 17: remove "face"
